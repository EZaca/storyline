# Storyline

## Introduction

The Storyline project allows the user to create a flow of scenes and animations.

In Javascript, most of the attentions point to timelines, while the language lacks of a flow control support. The Storyline project has a control based in a main document, scenes and actors. 

The project itself is an analogy to a theater, where you have a movie with many acts (scenes). When the act is changed, the curtains are closed, the stage is cleared and new actors are added to the next act. Once the curtains are open, the actors interact with each other.

## Who can use it?

Anyone that wants a hierarchy with a main piece, one or more scenes and actors interacting can use the project.
